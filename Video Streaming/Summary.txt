### âœ… **Candidate Explanation for the System Design Diagram**

In this architecture diagram, Iâ€™ve designed a **scalable video streaming platform** modeled after services like YouTube. The goal is to ensure the system is **modular, horizontally scalable, and optimized for performance, availability, and maintainability**.

---

### ðŸ”· **Whatâ€™s Represented**

1. **Client & Entry Point**

   * The diagram begins with a `Client` sending a request, which is routed through a **Load Balancer**.
   * The **Load Balancer** is responsible for:

     * SSL termination
     * Traffic distribution
     * Redirecting to appropriate internal services

2. **API Gateways (Layered Routing)**

   * Iâ€™ve introduced **multiple API Gateway instances** to decouple external traffic from internal service logic.
   * Each API Gateway can route traffic based on path, headers, or roles to specific backend services (e.g., Uploads, Video, Metadata).
   * This helps with **rate limiting, authentication, CORS handling**, and **centralized routing**.

3. **Backend Services**

   * Services like **Upload**, **Transcoding**, and **Video Service** are organized logically behind the gateways.
   * Each service is stateless and horizontally scalable.
   * Communication between services is mostly synchronous (solid arrows), with dashed lines indicating asynchronous flows (e.g., transcoding completion).

4. **Object Storage & Databases**

   * Videos are stored in a dedicated **Object Storage** system optimized for large media files.
   * **Metadata DB** stores video metadata (title, duration, tags, etc.)
   * **Video DB** stores additional structured video information used by recommendation engines.

5. **CDN and Analytics**

   * **CDN + Cache** ensures videos are served efficiently to global users with low latency.
   * A dedicated **Recommendations and Analytics Service** processes viewership data, helping power personalized content suggestions.

6. **Color-Coded Components & Legend**

   * The diagram is **color-coded** to distinguish:

     * Entry points (teal)
     * Gateways and services (orange)
     * Storage (green)
     * Databases and analytics (beige)
   * A **legend** is included for clarity and visual interpretation.

### ðŸ§  **Justification**

* **Layered routing with API Gateways** improves scalability, isolation, and operational flexibility.
* **Decoupling upload/transcode/video** services ensures each can scale independently.
* **Object storage** is chosen over traditional DBs for handling large video files efficiently.
* **Modular layout** makes it easier to onboard new teams, isolate failures, and apply CI/CD independently.
* **Using a CDN** and **recommendation engine** helps optimize user experience and platform engagement.

### âœ… Summary Statement

> This architecture supports high throughput, modularity, and global reach. It allows for secure, low-latency streaming while ensuring each component is independently deployable and horizontally scalable.
